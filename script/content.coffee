  Spells

  Text, notes, and mana are obvious. The rest:

  * {target}: one of [task, self, party, user]. This is very important, because if the cast() function is expecting one
    thing and receives another, it will cause errors. `self` is used for self buffs, multi-task debuffs, AOEs (eg, meteor-shower),
    etc. Basically, use self for anything that's not [task, party, user] and is an instant-cast

  * {cast}: the fucntion that's run to perform the ability's action. This is pretty slick - because this is exported to the
    web, this function can be performed on the client and on the server. `user` param is self (needed for determining your
    own stats for effectiveness of cast), and `target` param is one of [task, party, user]. In the case of `self` spells,
    you act on `user` instead of `target`. You can trust these are the correct objects, as long as the `target` attr of the
    spell is correct. Take a look at habitrpg/src/models/user.js and habitrpg/src/models/task.js for what attributes are
    available on each model. Note `task.value` is its "redness". If party is passed in, it's an array of users,
    so you'll want to iterate over them like: `_.each(target,function(member){...})`

  Note, user.stats.mp is docked after automatically (it's appended to functions automatically down below in an _.each)
